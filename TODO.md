#Calculators
* Beamwidth vs dish size
* Feasibility for given setup
    * A_eff (effective area)
    * A_temp    (Antenna temp)
    * Temp of given object for point and continuum
    * Necessary Jy or integration time or dish size.

    So this should give us:
        * I want to observe X, what do I need. (ideally what's the path to where I am now)
        * I have equipment/location/experience Y, what can I observe now?
